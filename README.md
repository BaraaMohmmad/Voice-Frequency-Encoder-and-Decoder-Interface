This project is aimed at designing, implementing, and testing an
English alphabet character voice-frequency encoder using
MATLAB. The encoder represents each English character with
three voice-band frequency components (low, middle, and high)
and includes a decoder capable of recovering text from the
encoded signals using frequency analysis and bandpass filters. Various MATLAB packages such as audioplayer, fft, abs, cell2mat, audiowrite, uigetfile, findpeaks, sort, and bandpass
filters are utilized in this project to achieve accurate encoding and
decoding of audio frequencies.
